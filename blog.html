                                1. LocalStorage Pros: 1. Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on
                                cookies, providing much greater storage capacity. If you look at the Mozilla source code
                                we can see that 5120KB (5MB which equals 2.5 Million chars on Chrome) is the default
                                storage size for an entire domain. 2. The data is not sent back to the server for every
                                HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing the amount of traffic
                                between client and server. 3. The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly
                                deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the
                                site. Cons: 1. It works on same-origin policy. So, data stored will only be available on
                                the same origin.
                                2. sessionStorage Pros: 1.It is similar to localStorage. 2. The data is not persistent
                                i.e. data is only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox).
                                Data is only available during the page session. Changes made are saved and available for
                                the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same tab/window. Once the
                                tab/window is closed, the data is deleted. Cons: 1. The data is available only inside
                                the window/tab in which it was set. 2. Like localStorage, it works on same-origin
                                policy. So, data stored will only be available on the same origin.

                                Global Scope Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
                                Variables declared with var , let and const are quite similar when declared outside a
                                block. They all have Global Scope: var x = 2; // Global scope. let x = 2; // Global
                                scope.

                                Block Scope: This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block,
                                from access by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the
                                variables to be block scoped.

                                The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If
                                the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and
                                will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a
                                tick in the Event Loop.
